#### ***\*Q: The M5 screen is not displaying anything. How can this issue be resolved?\****

1. Check the connection between the power adapter and the device. Try unplugging and re-plugging the power adapter.
2. Gently press the corners of the screen to ensure proper contact between the M5stack and the internal expansion board.
3. Refer to the gitbook and download the corresponding minirobot firmware.
4. For the 280m5 model from 2021, it is recommended to flash AtomMain2.8 with basic1.0 firmware.

 

#### ***\*Q: How to resolve the issue when the joints cannot be locked after powering up the robotic arm?\****

1. Check if the original power adapter is connected and if it is properly plugged in. Try unplugging and re-plugging the power adapter.

2.Check if the joints can move freely when powered off and if there are any excessive resistance or lack of resistance issues. Preliminary assessment can determine if there are any internal structural fractures. If no physical fractures are found, proceed with further checks.

3. For 320 series products, ensure the emergency stop switch is in the released position. Joints can only function properly when the emergency stop switch is released. If the emergency stop switch is in the stopped position (pressed), the device cannot be powered on or communicate normally. Turn the switch clockwise to release it.

4.Normally, the robotic arm should self-lock upon power-up, with the Atom light turning green.

If the Atom does not light up green or the joints do not self-lock, follow these steps for troubleshooting:

l Gently press the Atom screen to ensure proper contact between Atom and the internal components of the robotic arm.

l Refer to Chapter 5 and download the corresponding Atom firmware using mystudio based on the model and version information. Operation video for updating firmware with mystudio:

l After successfully burning the Atom firmware and with the robotic arm not connected to power, connect Atom using a type-C cable. If Atom lights up green but turns off after removing the type-C cable, it indicates a normal Atom but a problem with internal wiring or damage within the robotic arm, requiring technical assistance.

l If Atom does not light up green when connected via type-C cable without power, it indicates hardware damage to Atom, necessitating replacement through technical support.

 

#### ***\*Q: After pressing the emergency stop switch and releasing it again, the joints of the robotic arm cannot lock. How can the robotic arm be locked again?\****

The machine needs to be powered up again, for example, by using myblockly to power on the robot arm.

#### ***\*Q: How can joint jitter, excessive joint angle deviation, or weak joint dropping be optimized?\****

1. Refer to the robot parameter introduction section to check if the actual load is within the effective load range of the robotic arm. Excessive load can cause joint jitter. Reduce the load on the actual joints appropriately.
2. Change the motion mode to refresh mode to make the robotic arm's motion trajectory relatively smooth. For specific API, refer to set_fresh_mode(0).
3. Refer to Chapter 5 of the gitbook to calibrate the robotic arm's zero position. Alternatively, refer to the calibration steps in the following link:

4. Adjust the PID using the following linkï¼š

5. Refer to the gitbook chapter for downloading the corresponding version of Atom firmware using mystudio.

 

#### ***\*Q: What is the joint zero position?\****

In the example below, there is a curved groove designed between the joint and the edge of the joint shell, which is the joint zero position.

|<div align=center>< img src="../../../resources/3-UserNotes/14-IssueFAQ/h5.jpg/>| 

After calibration, the zero position posture is as follows:

|<div align=center>< img src="../../../resources/3-UserNotes/14-IssueFAQ/h6.jpg/>| 

Special attention should be paid to the zero position posture of joint 270:

#### ***\*Q: Is there a method for zero position calibration?\****
